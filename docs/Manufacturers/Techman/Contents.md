1. Techman [Controllers](../../Overview/Glossary.md#controller) use percentages for certain values in [Exported](../../Overview/Glossary.md#export) code. These can be defined using a percentage input of 1 SI unit of the value. e.g. for **Blends** in joint (PTP) moves set the radius as a percentage of _1m_ or for **Speed** in joint (PTP) moves set the positional speed as a percentage of _1m/s_. For speeds, you can also specify the joint speeds as percentages of their max values.
2. Techman [Controllers](../../Overview/Glossary.md#controller) use time to define acceleration in [Exported](../../Overview/Glossary.md#export) code. We interpret this as _1 / Acceleration in m/s_ as there is no direct conversion.
